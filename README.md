# PyTools

This repository contains various useful general use python tools split in different modules.

## Modules

* _filters.py_  
This module defines filters for data processing.

* _timedpid.py_  
This module defines a simple Proportional - Integral - Derivative (PID) controller with different time step calculation methods. This is a python implementation of my Arduino TimedPID library which can be found at https://github.com/DrGFreeman/TimedPID. Refer to this repository for detailed documentation.
